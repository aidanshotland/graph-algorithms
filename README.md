Programming project utilzing different sorting and MST algorithms.
1st part is a sort algorithm that prints the order of a Directed Acyclic Graph in topological order. Uses enhanced DFS to sort.
2nd part uses Kruskal's algorithm in order to solve minimum spanning tree problems.
  implements a graph class that add edges, find's a subtree, connects a subtree
Part 3 is a MST algorithm using Prim's. Returns the difference of weight between the original graph and the new MST to determine how much was saved.
The final problem prints "Big world" of two nodes in a graph are seperated by more than 6 nodes. Otherwise prints "Small World."
